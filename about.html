      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p><strong>LANY</strong> LANY (/ˈleɪni/, an acronym for "Los Angeles, New York") is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in Nashville in 2014, the band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Paul Jason Klein and drummer Jake Clifford Goss.
        Known for dreamy synth-pop and heartfelt lyrics, the band has touched millions of fans around the world with songs that blend love, nostalgia, and sincerity.
        Through Polydor and Interscope Records, the band released four albums: LANY (2017), Malibu Nights (2018), Mama's Boy (2020), and gg bb xx (2021). Of their singles, the most successful are the RIAA-certified "ILYSB" (2015), "Super Far" (2017), 
        "Malibu Nights" (2018), the Julia Michaels collaboration "Okay" (2019), and "Mean It" with Lauv (2019). In September 2023, the band released their fifth studio album A Beautiful Blur. This was their first album on their own imprint Sunset Records and 
        distributed via Virgin Music Group, following their departure from Polydor and Interscope Records. On July 30, 2025, the band announced their sixth studio album, Soft, which released on October 10, 2025.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>LANY were formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason Klein, who had a small solo career, flew to Nashville to meet up with friends Jake Goss and Les Priest. Previously, Goss and Priest had a separate project by the name of WRLDS, but this was discontinued 
        after the formation of LANY. Klein had been classically trained in piano and had been playing since early childhood. The following month they anonymously uploaded two songs, "Hot Lights" and "Walk Away", to their SoundCloud account with zero followers 
        in order to differentiate between their old and new projects. These two songs were recorded within the space of four days. In an interview, Klein explains that after the release of these singles, they began receiving emails from record labels within six days, 
        of which he still does not know how they found the music. Their debut EP, Acronyms, followed later that year, with the song "ILYSB" generating significant interest online, reaching more than 100,000 hits. Singles "Made in Hollywood" and "Bad, Bad, Bad" soon 
        followed, along with the reveal of their identities.</p>
      <p>LANY is an acronym for "Los Angeles New York". Klein explained the name in an interview: "We knew we wanted a four-letter word because of design and aesthetic purposes, but as you can imagine, all the four-letter words in the entire world are taken. 
        We moved to acronyms and for a while we thought we would be TTYL, but then we decided we didn’t 
        want to be 13 for the rest of our lives. I eventually thought of the span across the country from L.A. to New York, and at first I was thinking it would be L-A-N-Y, but people kept getting confused on how to pronounce it when I told them, saying things like 
        'L-A-and-Y?' So then we’re like forget it—let's call ourselves LANY, pronounced Lay-Nee."</p>

      <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vision:</strong> To connect people through honest and heartfelt music, turning love, loss, and hope into a universal language of feeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Mission:</strong> To create timeless and genuine music that speaks directly to the hearts of listeners around the world. To turn personal emotions and stories into songs that feel relatable, comforting, and real. 
          To spread messages of love, honesty, and vulnerability while staying true to simplicity and beauty. To build a safe emotional space where listeners feel understood, accepted, and never alone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>LANY aims to create music that transcends time, place, and language — songs that make people feel something real. Their goal is not only to produce chart-topping hits, but to build an emotional connection with listeners through melodies 
        that speak the language of love, heartbreak, and hope. Every lyric, every sound, and every silence is crafted to reflect the beauty of being human — fragile, honest, and full of meaning.
        As artists, they strive to evolve with every album, experimenting with new sounds while staying true to their essence: minimal, intimate, and deeply emotional. LANY’s journey is about exploring growth, both musically and personally, 
        while maintaining a sense of authenticity that their fans can always relate to.
        Beyond the music, their dream is to unite people from different corners of the world — to remind everyone that even when life feels lonely, feelings are what connect us all. Through their live shows, they want to create safe, emotional 
        spaces where fans can escape, breathe, and simply feel. Ultimately, LANY’s goal is to leave a lasting mark — a legacy of songs that become memories, companions, and reflections of love in all its forms.</p>
